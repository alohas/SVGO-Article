      <h2>What Is An Svg?</h2>
      <p>
        SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a resolution-independent graphics
        format. The big advantage is that SVGs look awesome on retina sdevices
        and work on the responsive web.
      </p>
      <h2>Why Use An SVG?</h2>
      <p>
        As mentioned, SVGs are resolution-independent graphics when most common
        images are pixel-based. This means that we don't have tu use
        Photoshop-based apps to change resolution and export over again. It
        doesn't matter if you draw your own SVGs or grab them from the web, most
        of the times such artworks are not produced with the web in mind. This
        means that you might find they’re filled with over-complicated paths.
        Also, since SVGs are XML-based, looking into the source code often shows
        a lots of unnecessary markup. The complexity of the markup increases
        file sizes and negatively impacts performance of the website.
      </p>
      <h2>Let's Go!!</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        For this example I will be using my Illustration:
      </p>
      <div class="containerPNG">
        <img class="png" src="img/rx7_png.png" alt="car" />
      </div>
      <p>
        I exported this artboard as 900x600px PNG. The weight of this file is
        66.5KB and we can only scale it down to preserve quality when an SVG
        file can be scaled how ever you want!
      </p>
      <p class="sub">SVG version of this Image:</p>
      <div class="containerSVG">
        <img src="svg/rx7.original.svg" alt="car" />
      </div>
      <p>
        The weight of this SVG is 44KB.
      </p>
      <p>
        So if we saved our artboard as an SVG, we already save 20KB of space for
        one image and quality increases immeasurably! Awesome! Right?
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        Here's an example how Adobe Illustrator generates code for your SVG
        file:
      </p>
      <div class="containerAnnot">
        <img class="annot" src="annotations/snippet_1.png" alt="annotation" />
      </div>
      <p>It is almost 500 lines for my illustration! This is a lot.</p>
      <p>
        And now comes the question: "Can we optimise it even more? And do we
        need all those lines of code?"
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the part where
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/svgo"
          >SVGO</a
        >
        comes to help!
      </p>

      <h2>What Is SVGO?</h2>
      <p>
        SVG Optimizer is a Nodejs-based tool for optimizing SVG vector graphics
        files.
      </p>

      <p>
        SVGO runs on
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          href="https://nodejs.org/en/"
          >Node.js</a
        >, an asynchronous, event-driven runtime to build scalable network
        applications. You don’t need to know how to build applications with
        Node.js to work with SVGO. Because you will only need your terminal to
        operate it!
      </p>
      <h2>How To Install?</h2>
      <p>
        First of all, you just have to install
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          href="https://nodejs.org/en/"
          >Node.js</a
        >
        by downloading the latest stable version for your operating system and
        follow the instructions in the installer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, you install SVGO by using Node’s package manager. By typing this
        in your terminal:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>  npm install -g svgo</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Now, you have installed SVGO globally in your computer so you can use it
        anywhere at any time.
      </p>
      <h2>How To Use It?</h2>
      <p>
        For most of us - basic developers, using default settings, it is enough.
      </p>
      <p>Here's an exmaple how to do it with only one command:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>  svgo filename.svg</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Using this command will optimise your SVG automatically. However, it
        will replace your original file with optimised one.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wouldn't recomend using this way because if you want to make any
        changes to it, your editor like Adobe Illustrator might not recognize
        the file anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prevent that I recomend defining an output with a folowing command:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>  svgo filename.svg -o filename.min.svg</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Now, you have two SVG files: filename.svg, which is the original file,
        and a new one optimised file: filename.min.svg!
      </p>
      <p class="sub">Let's try this on my example:</p>

      <div class="containerAnnot">
        <img class="annot" src="annotations/snippet_2.png" alt="snippet" />
      </div>

      <p>
        If you open filename.min.svg in a text-based editor, you will see a one
        long line of code, which means a much smaller file size. In my condition
        it saved me 24.3% of file size. But this is percentage from my original
        SVG. So if we look back at my PNG file, we can see that I have already
        saved around 50% from original 66.5KB!
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is how filename.min.svg (my case - rx7.min.svg) looks like after
        clean up!
      </p>
      <div class="containerSVG">
        <img src="svg/rx7.min.svg" alt="car" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Looks completely the same, but weighs much less! And this is what we
        needed in the first place!
      </p>
      <h2>What Can We Do More?</h2>
      <p>
        To customize the output SVGO generated files,we can enable or disable
        plugins. Full list of plugins can be found at
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          href="https://github.com/svg/svgo/"
          >GitHub</a
        >. However, for a basic user default options are the most optimal
        solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's try some out a disabled by default plugin. I will use reusePaths,
        which has to be insdide --enable=''. Here is how the whole command looks
        like:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>  svgo filename.svg -o filename.custom.min.svg --enable='reusePaths'</code>
      </pre>
      <p class="sub">Here's a snippet of my case:</p>
      <div class="containerAnnot">
        <img class="annot" src="annotations/snippet_3.png" alt="snippet" />
      </div>
      <p>
        We saved a little bit more space, but take A look what happened to my
        example SVG:
      </p>
      <div class="containerSVG">
        <img src="svg/rx7.custom.min.svg" alt="car" />
      </div>
      <p>
        We lost couple paths which destroys the illustration. And this is
        exactly what we want to avoid if using these complex svg files.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Conclusion
      </h2>
      <p>
        If you like to have your code optimised and a short page load time, it
        is a must to use SVGs as much as possible. For even more Optimisation
        SVGO is an awesome free tool that can be used by everyone to reeduce
        size of SVGs by editing the SVG code.
